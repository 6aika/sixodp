# This file reloads services when the preferred certificate for a hostname
# changes. A list of commonly used daemons is preconfigured. You can override
# this list by setting $SERVICES in /etc/{default,conf.d}/acme-reload.
#
# Configuration options:
#   /etc/{default,conf.d}/acme-reload
#     Sourced if they exist. Specify variables here.
#     Please note that most of the time, you don't need to specify anything.
#
#   $SERVICES
#     Space-separated list of daemons to reload.
#     Append with SERVICES="$SERVICES mydaemon".
