# WordPress

WordPress and its plugins should be upgraded automatically to latest version every time ansible is executed. Patch updates should be installed automatically by WordPress itself. 

If the upgrade fails for any reason, usually it is a permission issue on the server.

After the upgrade, the following list of features should be checked. There are no automated tests.

* Creating, editing and deleting page.
* Creating, editing and deleting post.
* Localization.
* Submitting showcase idea.
* Submitting dataset request.
